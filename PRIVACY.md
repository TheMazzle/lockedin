## What We Collect

This extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## What We Store

- **User preferences** (category toggle settings) are stored via Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API. This data never leaves your device except through Chrome's built-in sync if you have that enabled in your browser settings.
- **Session statistics** (blocked items count) are stored locally and reset when the browser restarts.

## Permissions Used

- `storage` — To save your blocking preferences
- `host_permissions` for `*://*.linkedin.com/*` — Required to modify LinkedIn pages and remove unwanted content

## Third-Party Services

None. This extension does not communicate with any external servers.

## Changes

Updates to this policy will be reflected in the extension's GitHub repository.
